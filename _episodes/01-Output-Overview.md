Last week we setup and ran our first CESM experiment. What did it do? How do I find and interpret the output from it?
There are several types of output form our model simulation:

1. Information in the `CaseStatus` file
2. Standard error and standard out
3. Log files
4. Model output data

In this episode, we will take a look at each of these and understand what they tell us.
